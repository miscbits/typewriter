# Typewriter 
Typewriter is a browser app written in laravel that allows you to focus on what you are writing without the distraction of having to edit it. It allows you to keep your thoughts going with no red and green lines, no distracting tool bars, and no pressure to have a perfect first draft. 

## Useage 
Consider using typewriter if you want to truly get in touch with your creative side. It is by no means a replacement for a word processor, but try using it to write your first draft before opening a word editor. 

## Concerns
Everything written in typewriter is invisible to any other user unless you wish to share the content yourself. If there are any security vulnerabilities discovered, please email <willow6786@gmail.com> so that they may be addressed. 

## Contributing 
Feel free to put in feature requests. I don't really have time to go through PR's at this time so its hard to say if I would be able to get around to it.

Typewriter is made with love using the Laravel framework.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
